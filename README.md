## What is it?
PatchDB is a Discord bot that collects presets and other producing goodies.

## Where do I get the presets?
They're in the [Patches folder](https://github.com/Knaque/patchdb/tree/main/patches). They can be downloaded individually there, or if you want to download everything, click [here](https://github.com/Knaque/patchdb/archive/main.zip).
